# 📖 Python Dictionary Operations  

This repository contains various **Python dictionary operations** with practical examples. It covers creating, accessing, modifying, looping through, and removing items from dictionaries using different techniques in Python.

## 🔄 **Features**  

✔ Create dictionaries with key-value pairs (strings, integers, booleans, nested dictionaries).  
✔ Access dictionary items using keys and `.get()`.  
✔ Modify dictionaries by updating values, adding new key-value pairs, and checking for key existence.  
✔ Loop through dictionaries using `.items()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`.  
✔ Remove dictionary items using `.pop()`, `del`, and `.clear()`.  
✔ Work with **nested dictionaries** and iterate through them efficiently.
